            <h2>Omni 1:26</h2>
            <p>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, 
               and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an coffering unto him, and continue in fasting 
               and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.
            </p>

            <p>And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your 
               countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?
